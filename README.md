### 1. Reducing the costs of a billing company

#### The problem

##### For a billing company in Houston, mailing invoices is their second largest expense. Using their data, my goal as a data scientist is to see if I can predict which people are less likely to pay their invoices so that the billing company knows to send less invoices, and thus save money.

#### Presentation

##### I plan to use a combination of Jupyter Notebook slides and meaningful visualizations to present my findings.

#### Data sources

##### Provided by company already

#### Next steps:

##### Already performed initial data exploration, working on feature selection now.
